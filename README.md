# MangoDB-Challenge
This is the MongoDB Challenge assigned to me.

This works by using Visual Studio Code, MongoDB and Postman

The code has 3 routes:
  - One route allows you to input superheroes and what universe they're from. Then using Postman, the data is sent via a post request and the server takes all of the data and creates a document using MongoDB.
  - The second route allows to retrieve a hero via it's Object ID
  - The third route allows to retrieve all heroes in an array.
